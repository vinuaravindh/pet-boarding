        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Sangeetha, a devoted pet lover residing in Sharjah. Pets have been an integral part of my life since childhood, and their care is not just an occupation for me, but a deeply cherished passion. As a stay-at-home mom who's experienced firsthand the challenge of finding a reliable pet sitter, I decided to offer a solution to this common problem by becoming one myself. My family shares my love for pets, with my children offering endless hugs and cuddles to our furry guests. Join me on this exciting journey and let's provide your pet with a loving, comfortable, and safe environment!</p>
